# TODO
- [ ] Show diagram of connections
- [ ] Need to improve precision to 3decimal places
- [ ] Layout improvements (portrait on mobile)
- [ ] Pre fill the box with 'common' resistors e.g. all of E24
- [ ] Show total range of possible output voltage accounting for the tolerance of resistors being uses (which an be determined from their E series)
- [ ] Allow for specifying tolerance of a resistor during the input stage in brackets (which also sets its E number)
- [ ] Add tool tip to Available Resistors which explains the colours and the toggle on/off feature
