# TODO

- [ ] Create a feature to save and load resistor configurations.
- [ ] Show diagram of connections
- [ ] Hold resistors in list allow for toggle on/off and recalculate
- [ ] LUT for resistor series to check if input values match real resistors
- [ ] Need to improve precision to 3decimal places
- [ ] In results provide an adjuster to see how other supply voltages would impact the output for a given configuration
- [ ] Need to handle input of 2.2k instead of 2k2
