# Voltage Divider Resistor Calculator

A tool for finding optimal resistor combinations from a limited set to create a voltage divider. For example, make use of resistor values already present in your design to limit the number unique items in your BOM.

## Features

- Calculate voltage divider combinations using available resistor values
- Support for resistors in series and parallel combinations
- Standard electronics notation for resistor values (e.g. 200R, 1K, 5K1, 1M)
- Shows top 5 best matches sorted by error

## Usage

1. Enter your available resistor values as comma-separated numbers (e.g., `10,220,470,1000,2k2,1M`)
2. Enter your supply voltage (V)
3. Enter your target output voltage (V)
4. Click "Calculate Combinations"

The calculator will show you the best combinations of resistors that will give you the closest voltage to your target.


### Example

**Input:**   
Resistor Values: `100,220,470,1000,2200,4700`   
Supply Voltage: `12`   
Target Voltage: `5`   
   
**Output will show combinations like:**
```
R1: 1k + 2k2 (3k2)
R2: 4k7 (4k7)
Output Voltage: 5.12 V
Error: 0.12 V
Components: 4
Output Voltage Range: 3.30V to 3.45V
```

- The error value indicates how far from the target Vout an idealised divider would in volts. Positive numbers overshoot and negative numbers are under the target.   

- The output voltage range shows the possible range where the Vout might be accounting for the real life tolerances of components. Tolerances are determined by the E series for a given value and the calculator determines the range by trying the permutations of upper and lower bounds for a given value for each resistor in the network. 

### Sorting results

The options panel allows for precise filtering and sorting of the results. As there are often many results, the tool only shows the top 5 based on the filter and sort options.

- Sort by radio buttons change the criteria by which the results are shown
- The total resistance slider can be moved from either end to only show results within a certain range, useful if you are looking for a target total resistance to match the impedance of a DAC or have overall power draw requirements in a battery powered application. 
  - Grab the handles to adjust the range and drag the body to the slider to shift the range

## Resistor Value Notation

The calculator can use variety of notation styles when entering resistor values:
- Plain numbers for ohms:
    - 10 → 10 Ohm
    - 1000 → 1 kilo Ohm
- Electronics notation:
    - 100m → 100 milli Ohm
    - 10R → 10 Ohm
    - 1k → 1 kilo Ohm → 1000 Ohm
    - 43k2 → 42.3 kilo Ohm → 42300 Ohm
    - 10M → 10 mega Ohm → 10000000 Ohm
- Mixed electronic and decimal notation:
    - 71.5k → 71k5 → 71.5 kilo Ohm → 71500 Ohm
- Scientific notation:
    - 5.1e3 → 5k1 → 5100 Ohm


It is possible to use these styles in combination e.g. `10, 330R, 4k7, 5.1e3, 10e6` when inputting values

## How It Works
The calculator:
1. Takes your available resistor values
2. Generates all possible combinations (single resistors, series, and parallel)
3. Calculates the output voltage for each combination
4. Sorts the results by how close they get to your target voltage
5. Shows the top 5 best matches
